# CL-Games
A simple list of command line games.

As a disclaimer, this is not really anything serious, but rather a project to have a little bit of fun,
practice some of the basics of programming, get more comfortable with some java features, as well as OOP.
Also, sort of need to get more comfortable with Git, because I push something and then don't do anything else
for a few months so I completely forget how to use it.

Anyways, if you happen to come accross this and can offer criticsm, feel free to message me on discord.
